# Moodle Unit Test Question #

This is a plugin for [Moodle](http://moodle.org) that adds a new question type where your students will be able to type in source code - just Java for now - and have the server compile it, run it, and check it against a JUnit test file.

The jumping off point came from two previous Moodle plugins - [sojunit](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=102690) and [javaunittest](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=qtype_javaunittest). Much credit goes to the authors of those two plugins. Unfortunately, neither was exactly what I was looking for so I've cloned the javaunittest git repo as a starting point.

Ultimately I'd like to have this question type grade more than just Java, but for now that's what's there.
