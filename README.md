# Moodle Unit Test Question #

This is a plugin for Moodle that adds a new question type where your students will be able to type in source code - just Java for now - and have the server compile it, run it, and check it against a JUnit test file.

The jumping off point came from two previous Moodle plugins - sojunit and javaunittest. Much credit goes to the authors of those two plugins. Unfortunately, neither was exactly what I was looking for so I've cloned the javaunittest git repo as a starting point.

Ultimately I'd like to have this question type grade more than just Java, but for now that's what's there.

## Not quite working... ##
Probably worth mentioning that this plugin does not work right now. It'll look okay, but the grading isn't correct. So, now isn't the right time to upload this to your server and try it out.
